DONE:
1) implemeted all the controllers, both for regulation and for tracking
2) obstacle avoidance, using sensor (offline implementation)
3) parking

TODO:
1) add sharp corners to test criticisms of some controllers
2) test the performance of all controllers (traj+regul)
3) test obstacle avoidance in different spots on the circuit
4) full path for parking (possibile S shape ?)
6) PRO version: moving obstacle avoidance
