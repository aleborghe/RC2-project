DONE:
1) implemeted all the controllers, both for regulation and for tracking
2) obstacle avoidance, using sensor (offline implementation)
3) parking
4) add sharp corners to test criticisms of some controllers
5) online version for obstacle avoidance

TODO:
1) test the performance of all controllers (traj+regul)
2) test obstacle avoidance in different spots on the circuit
3) full path for parking (possibile S shape ?)
4) tuning gains for each controller
5) PRO version: moving obstacle avoidance
